    <p>Hi, my name is Francis Kyle Lumayaga, and I am a 20-year old student. I am passionate about irl painting, and I love learning new things and meeting new people. In my free time, I enjoy eating and just play videogames. I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally</p>

    <p>Sure! Here's a short introduction of yourself: <br><br> "Hi, I'm John Melbur Cabiso! I have a talent for drawing, especially in MS Paint, where I enjoy pushing its limits to create detailed artwork. I also have skills in programming, particularly in Java, and I love solving problems through code. Beyond that, I play the guitar and experiment with different sounds. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and challenge myself creatively!"
