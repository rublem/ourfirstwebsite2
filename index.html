    <h3>About John:</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm John Melbur Cabiso! I have a talent for drawing, especially in MS Paint, where I enjoy pushing its limits to create detailed artwork. I also have skills in programming, particularly in Java, and I love solving problems through code. Beyond that, I play the guitar and experiment with different sounds. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and challenge myself creatively!</p>
